				On your 57th day in the refugee camp you have to wonder, how am I still alive? It's most likely luck if you haven't read this yet, 
				if you're like me and you're secretely using the camp guard's computer to send or read blog posts then this blog post is for you. 
				<br><br>
				Firstly, it might be a good idea to stop - drop and leaving out the roll. Don't run around and waste energy, only move when necassery. 
				Also stressing about your solution is bad, stress uses energy and you don't want to waste energy. Food is scarce so once you get some
				then you have to eat it no matter how rotten or filthy it is. When you cook it, rather overcook it than undercook it to kill more germs
				since germs is not something that you want to welcome into your body.
				<br><br>
				As you may have realised, hunger changes people - don't expect that everyone keeps their morals when they're starving due to hunger.
				What I mean by this is that don't let people see your stored water or food, thieving is very frequent in refugee camps.
				<br><br>
				Sickness is the main killer in the camp, and the main cause of sickness is either infection or having a bad immune system due to bad practices
				which then leads to getting a normal sickness. As mentioned earlier, don't allow germs into your body, not by cooking nor by infection by others
				this means being the lonely person in a corner might be to your benefit.
				<br><br>
				You might just survive with a bit of determination and luck, but don't let just that be your main deciding benefactor. Keep a positive view 
				on life, so that you don't get stressed out or fall into deep depression. To summarize what I've been saying thus far, don't eat bad food,
				don't get sick, don't stress and try your best not to die.
				<br>
				Good luck refugees!
